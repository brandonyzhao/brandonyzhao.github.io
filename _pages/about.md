Third-year PhD student at Caltech studying Computing and Mathematical Sciences. I was previously supported by the Gupta Fellowship. 

Previously at Duke, studying Mathematics, Computer Science and Statistics. 

My research interests include computational imaging and computer vision. Currently I'm working on using computational imaging techniques for astrophysical applications.
