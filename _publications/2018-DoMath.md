Studied asymptotics of the contact process on random periodic trees. In particular, I helped to derive bounds for critical values of phase transitions for the contact process on \\((1,n)\\) trees as well as \\((a,b,c)\\) trees. This work was the result of a group project advised by Professors Rick Durrett and Matthew Junge at Duke as part of the DoMath program.
